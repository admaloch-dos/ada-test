<b>About this Project:</b><br/>
Flourish is a custom accessibility menu created for the Florida Memory website. This collaborative effort between my predecessor and me aims to enhance the user experience for individuals facing disabilities that impede their access to our site's content. The menu boasts customizable options, allowing users to control how page content is presented. It also incorporates a suite of tools to facilitate more effective content access. To access the menu, simply click on the ADA icon located at the bottom of the screen. Note that the rest of the page is included for testing purposes and is not part of this project.

<b>Takeaways:</b><br/>
This project represents my most significant undertaking to date. Understanding the diverse needs of potential users, including those who are visually impaired, hard of hearing, rely on screen readers, or are color-blind, posed a unique challenge. Throughout the development process, my ability to comprehend and implement features for a diverse user base improved significantly. Additionally, I gained extensive knowledge of web accessibility standards, enabling me to construct websites and applications with inclusivity in mind. Another significant challenge was ensuring the project's modularity for seamless integration into other websites, requiring meticulous testing and debugging.

<b>Current Status:</b>
The project is nearing completion. Once finished, it will undergo final testing for bugs/issues before being implemented live on the Florida Memory website. In the future, there are considerations for releasing it as an open-source plugin.

<b>Note:</b>
The Florida Department of State prioritizes security, and version control software is not allowed, limiting the visibility of detailed Git history for this project.
