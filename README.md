# flourish-accessibility-widget

<b>About this project:</b><br/> 
This is Flourish, a custom accessibility menu built for the FLorida Memory website. This was a collaboration between the developer who previously held my position, and myself. This menu was built with the intent of improving the experience for users who suffer from disabilities that impair their ability to access the content on our website. It consists of customizable options that allow the user control over how the content of the page is presented, and has a set of tools that allow them to access the content on the page more effectively. Access the menu by clicking on the ADA icon at the bottom of the screen. The rest of the page is a random page pulled from the Florida Memory website for the sake of testing and is not part of this project.

<b>Takeaways:</b><br/> 
The is the biggest project I've worked on to date. The biggest chalenge was trying to understand the needs of people who could benefit from a tool like this. Ex. People who are visually impaired, are hard of hearing, rely on screen readers, are color blind, etc.. Throughout the development process, my ability to understand the needs of and implement features for a diverse set of users improved greatly. In addition, I learned alot about web accessibility standards and can now effectively build web sites and applications with these standards in mind. The other challenge was building it to be as modular as possible so that it could translate to other websites. This process involved a painstaking testing/debugging process. Finally, I learned a lot about using cookies and local storage to allow users to mainain their custom settings.

<b>Current status:</b><br/> 
The project is close to being finished. Once it is complete it will go through final testing for bugs/issues then implemented live on the Florida Memory website. In the future, it may be released as an open source plugin.

<b>Note:</b><br/> 
The Florida Department of State is very security focused and version control software is not allowed so you may not see a much of a detailed git history for this project.
